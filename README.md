# RepData_PeerAssessment2
Repository for Peer Assessment 2 of Coursera Reproducible Data class

Most of the previous course projects involved cloning a git repository. 
This one focuses on publishing the report to RPub, so I am using this as an opportunity to practice with ProjectTemplate.

In R Studio, I did:  
install.packages('ProjectTemplate')  
library('ProjectTemplate')  

setwd("~/Coursera/ReproducibleResearch/RepData_PeerAssessment2")  
create.project('SevereWeatherAssessment')

setwd('SevereWeatherAssessment')  
library('ProjectTemplate')  
load.project()

The project files are located in the [SevereWeatherAssessment directory](SevereWeatherAssessment)
